# Executive Summary  
## Olist E-Commerce Operations & Customer Experience Analysis

## Objective
The goal of this analysis was to evaluate the operational performance and customer experience of Olist’s Brazilian e-commerce platform, with a focus on order growth, delivery performance, customer satisfaction, and payment behavior. Using transactional, logistics, payment, and review data, the analysis sought to identify trends, operational risks, and opportunities for improvement as the platform scaled.

## Key Findings

### 1. Strong Growth in Orders and Revenue
Order volume and total revenue increased significantly over time, particularly throughout 2017 and early 2018. Growth was not driven by increasing order values, but rather by higher transaction volume. Average order value remained relatively stable, indicating that revenue growth was primarily volume-led rather than price-led.

---

### 2. Delivery Performance Improved Over Time
Across all delivered orders, the average delivery time was approximately **12.5 days**. However, delivery performance improved substantially over time. During peak growth and seasonal demand periods (late 2017 to early 2018), average delivery times increased to **15–17 days**, suggesting temporary logistics strain. From mid-2018 onward, delivery times improved sharply, falling to **under 8 days**, indicating operational and fulfillment improvements as the platform matured.

### 3. Late Deliveries Were Infrequent but Impactful
Approximately **93%** of delivered orders were early or on time, reflecting strong reliability in meeting estimated delivery promises. However, about **6.8%** of orders were delivered late, with nearly **3%** delayed by more than eight days. While these late deliveries represent a minority of orders, their impact on customer satisfaction was significant.

---

### 4. Customer Satisfaction Closely Tied to Delivery Performance
Customer review scores remained consistently high overall, averaging between **4.1 and 4.3** across most months. Notable declines in satisfaction occurred during periods of longer delivery times and higher late-delivery rates, particularly between **November 2017 and March 2018**. As delivery performance improved in mid-2018, review scores recovered and stabilized at their highest levels, demonstrating a clear relationship between logistics performance and customer sentiment.

---

### 5. Repeat Customers Are Slightly More Satisfied
Repeat customers exhibited marginally higher average review scores compared to one-time customers, suggesting that customers who continue using the platform tend to have better overall experiences. This highlights the importance of maintaining delivery reliability and service quality to encourage customer retention.

---

### 6. Payment Behavior Insights
Credit cards dominated payment methods, accounting for approximately **74%** of transactions, followed by boleto payments at **19%**. Analysis of installment payments revealed a strong positive relationship between installment count and order value: orders with higher installment counts were associated with substantially higher average order values. This suggests that installment options play an important role in enabling higher-value purchases.

---

## Business Implications
- Delivery reliability and speed are critical drivers of customer satisfaction and retention  
- Operational scalability is essential during periods of rapid growth to prevent declines in customer experience  
- Installment payment options meaningfully support higher-value transactions and should remain a strategic focus  
- Targeted improvements in handling severe delivery delays could yield outsized gains in customer satisfaction  

---

## Conclusion
Overall, Olist demonstrates strong growth, high customer satisfaction, and improving operational maturity. While periods of rapid expansion introduced temporary logistics challenges, subsequent improvements in delivery performance led to measurable gains in customer sentiment. Continued investment in logistics optimization and customer experience will be key to sustaining long-term growth and customer loyalty.
